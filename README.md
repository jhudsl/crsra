This in an R package for cleaning and some preliminary analysis of
Coursera research data exports. The package helps import and organize
all the tables in R. It also run some preliminary analysis on the data.
Note that this package is still under development and the auther
appreciates feedback and suggestions.

## Setup

to install this package, you will need to install `devtools`. Install
the [devtools package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools),
available from CRAN.

``` r
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jhudsl/crsra", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

Research on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is young.\[1\] studied
literature published on MOOCs through 2015 and found that the number of
articles published on the subject increased from 1 in 2008 to 170 in
2015. More research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness,
reach, limits, and the potential of MOOCs. However, the main challenges
in studying MOOCs remains to be data. Data on MOOCs are not usually
publicly available since it is owned by private providers and there are
concerns about the privacy of students. More importantly, as Lopez et.
al\[2\] point out, the size and complexity of MOOC data is an
overwhelming challenge to many researchers. Therefore, it is imperative
to provide tools that pave the way for more research on the new subject
of MOOCs.

This paper introduces a package called `crsra` based on the statistical
software R to help clean and analyze massive loads of data from the
Coursera MOOCs. Coursera is one of the leading providers of MOOCs and
was launched in January 2012. With over 25 million learners, Coursera is
the most popular provider in the world being followed by EdX, the MOOC
provider that was a result of a collaboration between Harvard University
and MIT, with over 10 million users. Coursera has over 150 university
partners from 29 countries and offers a total of 2000+ courses from
computer science to philosophy.\[3\] Besides, Coursera offers 180+
specialization, Coursera’s credential system, and four fully online
Masters degrees. A typical course on Coursera includes recorded video
lectures, graded assignment, quizzes, and discussion forums.

Since the early years of the company, Coursera has encouraged
researchers to analyze students’ data and has facilitated the use of the
data and the platform for A/B testing. Starting November 2015 Coursera
introduced a dashboard for self-service data exports. Through this tool,
partner institutions and instructors could download data for a single
course or all courses associated with the institution. Research data
exports are sets of CSV files and are designed for use in relational
database systems. One of the advantages of the data is the existence of
a single *hashed user ID* for each student. This user ID is consistent
for learners across all courses offered by an individual institution and
allows for connecting learner grades and progress across courses.

The advantages of the package are as follows:

  - faster loading of data for analysis
  - efficient method for combining data from multiple courses and even
    across institutions. This is important since although MOOC
    researchers have access to thousands of students in their sample,
    few studies benefit from data across multiple courses and
    institutions. Such analysis helps draw more robust conclusions about
    student behaviors.\[4\]
  - provision of a set of functions for analyzing student behaviors.

## Coursera Research Data

There are five types of research data export for each course. Table
below summarizes these five types. The data are written in roughly 100
tables containing information such as course content, students’
demographic data, progress, and outcomes, and forum
data.

| Data Type                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Assessment submission data | Assessment submissions of quizzes, peer review, and programming assignments by learners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Course grade data          | Contains the highest grade achieved by each learner on each required assessment as well as the time stamp of the learner’s highest-scoring submission. This table also includes each learner’s overall grade in the course.                                                                                                                            |
| Course progress data       | Contains data documenting the time stamp for when the learner interacted with each piece of course content and the time stamps for when items were opened, completed, reopened, reattempted, etc.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Demographic data           | Contains the following information for all enrolled learners: general geographical data (based on IP address), browser language preference, and information for learners who completed their learner profile responses or participated in Coursera’s platform-wide demographic survey (including age, gender, education level, and employment status). |
| Discussion data            | Contains forum activity data such as posts, responses, upvotes/downvotes, flags, and questions and answers associated with course content items.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Figure below shows different types of research data exports provided by
Coursera.

While Coursera provides tools for creating PostgreSQL databases in a
docker container,\[5\] as we mentioned earlier, importing data for
analysis remains to be a challenge for researchers with limited
experience with relational databases. Moreover, such tools are usually
not platform independent.\[6\]

## The `crsra` Package

The `crsra` package helps import and organize Coursera’s research data
exports into R. It also runs some preliminary analysis on the data. In
the following section, we introduce the package and provide instruction
on how to import Coursera research data exports. To install this
package, you can either directly install the package from CRAN by
`install.packages("crsra")` or install the development version through
`devtools`, then execute the following commands:

``` r
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jhudsl/crsra", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Importing Data

To import your data dump into R, you will first need to unzip your data
exports into one folder. There are two ways to import the data. You can
import all your courses at once by poining your working directoty to the
folder that contains all the unzipped folders as following. Then execute
the command `crsra_import`. Setting the `check_problems` attribute to
FALSE will turn off warnings when importing the csv files.

``` r
my_import <- crsra_import(workdir = ".", check_problems = TRUE)
```

A specific course within a course can be called as follows

``` r
user_table <- my_import[["Regression Models"]][["users"]]
```

or in a pipe

``` r
library(dplyr)
user_table <- my_import %>% 
    .[["Regression Models"]] %>% 
    .[["users"]]
```

A second method is to import an individual course. For this type of
import unzip the data export for the course and set your working
directly to the folder that contains all the csv
tables.

``` r
my_course_import <- crsra_import_course(workdir = ".", check_problems = TRUE)
```

Calling a table is a little different in this method since the imported
data only contains one course. To call a table execute

``` r
user_table_2 <- my_course_import[["users"]]
```

or in a pipe

``` r
library(dplyr)
user_table_2 <- my_course_import %>% 
    .[["users"]]
```

You can also dowanload the dummy data included in the `inst/extdata`
folder in the package source codes. If you are not pointing to the
correct directory, you will receive a warning, and the execution will be
halted. Note that the data import may take some time if the course data
is large and there are several courses in your working directory.

To see the data import in use, we use the package on data from Johns
Hopkins University (JHU) Data Science Specialization on Coursera. This
specialization, developed by Jeffrey Leek, Roger Peng, and Brian Caffo,
consists of ten courses. There have been more than two million
enrollments since the launch of this program in April 2014. The size of
data on the students who took these ten courses since 2015 is around 18
gigabytes. In the following example, we use the `crsra` package to
import a Coursera data dump at our disposal on all the courses and to
find the number of students who passed a specific course item (course
item `67c1O`) in the course “Regression Models.”

``` r
my_import %>% 
    .[["Regression Models"]] %>% 
    .[["course_item_grades"]] %>%
    filter(course_item_id == "67c1O") %>% 
    filter(course_item_passing_state_id == 2) %>% 
    summarise(n = n())

# A tibble: 1 x 1
#      n
#   <int>
# 1  8640
```

## Other Functions in the Package

The package also includes a few other functions in addition to the main
`crsra_import()` function. A list of functions and their descriptions is
provided in the table
below.

| Function                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `crsra_membershares`    | Returns a summary of the total number and the shares of users in each course broken down by factors such as roles, country, language, gender, employment status, education level, and student status.                                                                                          |
| `crsra_gradesummary`    | Returns total grade summary broken down by the factors mentioned above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `crsra_progress`        | Summarizes, for each course item, the total number and the share of users who ceased activity at that specific course item. The function ranks course items by their attrition.                                                                                                                |
| `crsra_assessmentskips` | Users may “skip” reviewing a peer-assessed submission if there is a problem with it. This function categorizes skips by their type such as “inappropriate content”, “plagiarism”, etc. The function also returns a word cloud appeared in peer comments as to why they skipped the submission. |
| `crsra_timetofinish`    | Calculates the time to finish a course for each user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `crsra_anonymize`       | Anonymizes the list of columns passed to the function given an algorithm (default is “crc32”)                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `crsra_deleter_user`    | Deletes a specific user from all the tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `crsra_tabledesc`       | Provides the description of the table passed to the function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `crsra_whichtable`      | Returns a list of tables that include the variable passed to the function                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Similar to the example above, we can use the function
`crsra_gradesummary()` to calculate the average student grade for the
courses in the data import. By using the argument `groupby` we can
calculate average grades for different learner subgroups based on
gender, education, student status, employment status, and country. For
instance, the following analysis returns the average overall course
grade for male and female learners in the course *The Data Scientist’s
Toolbox*. The results show that female learners’ grades are on average 6
points lower on a 100 scale than male learners’ grades.

``` r
crsra_gradesummary(my_import, groupby = "gender") %>% 
    .[["Regression Models"]]

#Note that maximum grade possible is 1.
# A tibble: 2 x 2
#  reported_or_inferred_gender  AvgGrade
#                        <chr>     <dbl>
#1                        male 0.7250660
#2                      female 0.6691554
```

## A Preliminary Analysis of Student Behavior on Coursera

The existence of fundamental differences between traditional education
and MOOCs has attracted a new wave of studies on students’ behavior and
outcomes in the online world. These differences are best reflected in
the definition of MOOCs by McAuley et al.\[7\] that “\[a\]n online
course with the option of free and open registration, a publicly shared
curriculum, and open-ended outcomes which integrates social networking,
accessible online resources … and most significantly builds on the
engagement of learners who self-organize their participation according
to learning goals, prior knowledge and skills, and common interests.”
Such differences require further research on MOOCs. Understanding how
students progress through an education program is critical for any
educational planning and decision making.\[8\] Models of student
progress are needed to estimate the probability of a student completing
a particular item in a course and predict the time required to finish a
course. Furthermore, conventional measures of academic success and
progress cannot be defined in the same way for MOOCs. For instance, as
Perna et al.\[9\] state, we have limited knowledge on whether learners’
progress through a MOOC should be measured in a sequential fashion or in
a way that captures the flexibility and freedom in learning behavior
that is unique to MOOCs.

There are only a handful of studies on students’ progress and outcomes
in MOOCs. Perna et al. perform a descriptive analysis of student
progress through a set of 16 courses on Coursera. They found that most
users accessed course content in the sequential order defined by the
instructor of the course. Ho et al.\[10\] study 17 courses taught on EdX
and found that most of the attrition in online courses happen in the
first week of course activity (about 50 percent attrition) and that the
average percentage of learners who cease activity in the second week
declines sharply to 16 percent. Most of these studies are specific to a
set of courses or platforms. Due to the many differences in the
characteristics of MOOCs, any extrapolation of the results to MOOCs in
general has to be done with caution.

In the following section, we will investigate students’ progress through
the ten Data Science Specialization courses on Coursera provided by JHU.
Using the `crsra_timetofinish` function in the `crsra` package, we can
first investigate the time difference between the first and last
activities in a course for each student. Time to finish is only
calculated for those who completed the course. Figure below depicts the
density plot for time to complete for three of the courses in the
specialization. Note that the density plot varies across courses. While
for *Developing Data Products* and *Getting and Cleaning Data* a
majority of students finish the courses in around 30 days, for *Data
Science Capstone* a majority of students finish the course in 50 days.

``` r
ttf <- crsra_timetofinish(my_import)
```
